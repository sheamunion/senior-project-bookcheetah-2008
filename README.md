### About the Project
BOOKCHEETAH is the brainchild of Lewis Muller. He and fellow James Madison University graduates Shea Munion, Matt Kattler, and Brian Armstrong wrote and submitted a business plan for the app in James Madison University’s Venture Creation Business Plan competition. Our business plan won second-place. (<a href="http://www.jmu.edu/cob/about/2008-news-archive.shtml">"Venture Creation Explores Viable Start-ups”</a>) The app itself won the Department of Integrated Science and Technology’s Community Impact Award. Shea Munion's Senior Honors Thesis is in print at the JMU library: <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/developing-and-integrating-an-online-textbook-trading-application-with-facebook-platform-amazon-web-services-php-and-mysql/oclc/317699283">“Developing and integrating an online textbook trading application with Facebook platform, Amazon web services, PHP, and MySQL”</a>.
