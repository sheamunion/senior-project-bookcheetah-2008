He and fellow James Madison University graduates Shea Munion, Matt Kattler, and Brian Armstrong wrote and submitted a business plan for the app in James Madison University’s Venture Creation Business Plan competition. Our business plan won second-place. ([\"Venture Creation Explores Viable Start-ups”](http://www.jmu.edu/cob/about/2008-news-archive.shtml)) The app itself won the Department of Integrated Science and Technology’s Community Impact Award.
